SkilStak's discord bot.

## About

skilbot® is a golang moderation and integration bot for SkilStak®'s Discord
server. It helps to register users and link them with their IRL name,
posts updates from github repos and Mr. Rob's blog to appropriate
channels and logs deleted messages.

## Files

Along with the go files that... well *are* the bot, the bot needs
a json file to tell it what it likes and who it is. An example one is
provided (titled preferences.json) but note that the authentication
fields are empty (so our bot doesn't get hijacked)

## Changing the SkilBot used on the server

Although this repo isn't exactly the source code for the real SkilBot,
we would be happy to take in any suggestions for the bot. Simply fork
this and put in a pull request. If its accepted it will be put onto
the real skilbot.
